# Personal Discord Bot

- This is a Discord bot written in Python for my personal tests with Discord API
- This Bot works with Riot Games API and has commands working with League of Legends API

If you want to use this bot as a base, you must create the RIOT_TOKEN and DISCORD_TOKEN
files and paste your own token.

Any improvements to this code are welcome ðŸ˜‰
